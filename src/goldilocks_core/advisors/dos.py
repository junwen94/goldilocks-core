"""dos: ``dos.x``'s own settings, from the nscf step's occupations.

New in v2 (v2 epic 9, #9) -- first (and, per this epic's own scope,
deliberately only) advisor DOS multi-step scaffolding needs to prove
``DosSettings`` (``step_settings.py``, epic 6) has a real producer, not
full DOS science. QE's own ``INPUT_DOS.html`` (fetched and read
2026-09-14) is explicit that several of these have no fixed default at
all -- this module says so plainly rather than inventing one where QE
itself does not.

**``ngauss``**: QE's own documented default is ``0`` (a plain Gaussian).

**``degauss`` (this module's ``broadening``)**: QE's own doc says an
unset value falls back to whatever the *upstream* scf/nscf calculation
used, or ``DeltaE`` (in Ry) if that in turn is unset. This module reads
the real upstream value directly (the nscf step's own resolved
``OccupationsDecision.degauss``) instead of leaving a gap for QE to fill
implicitly by reading the previous calculation's save file -- consistent
with this codebase writing every value explicitly rather than relying on
implicit QE fallbacks. When the nscf step used a tetrahedron method
(no smearing width exists at all -- exactly what ``service/_dos.py``'s
``_nscf_overrides`` forces, per aiida-quantumespresso's own
``pdos.yaml`` protocol, confirmed against its source 2026-09-14),
``broadening`` is correctly left ``None``: QE's
own ``bz_sum`` default already switches to a tetrahedron integration
method whenever no ``degauss`` is given, so leaving it unset here is the
physically correct choice, not a gap.

**``delta_e``**: QE's ``INPUT_DOS.html`` lists no default at all (a
required value). ``0.01`` eV is not invented here -- it is
aiida-quantumespresso's own ``workflows/protocols/pdos.yaml``
``dos.parameters.DOS.deltae`` default (its "balanced" and "stringent"
protocols both use it; only its "fast"/testing protocol relaxes to
``0.1``), confirmed against that file's source 2026-09-14.

**``emin``/``emax``**: left ``None`` unless a human overrides them. QE's
own documented default is "band extrema" -- the full computed energy
range -- which is exactly what omitting the keyword already gives;
guessing a narrower, Fermi-relative window without having actually run
the calculation first would be an invented number this module has no
basis for.

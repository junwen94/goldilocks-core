"""vdw_method: whether to add a dispersion (van der Waals) correction, and
which one, from geometry and the chosen functional.

Ported as decision content from v1's `advice/parameters.py:_advise_vdw`
(lines 309-368, v2 epic 5, #5): low-dimensional structures default to D3BJ,
3D/undetermined defaults to no correction, operator hints always win. That
logic is correct and is reused; two things change around it.

First, the tri-state rewrite: v1's "hint ignored because vdW is off" case
was smuggled into a free-text warning string (lines 350-355) rather than a
structured field -- still surfaced as a warning here (nowhere else to put a
"you asked for X, it was not applied" note), but on a value that is always
``Resolved``, not a silent default with no way to tell it apart from a real
decision.

Second, this now reads `functional` (this epic's `advisors/functional.py`)
to avoid recommending a correction on top of a functional that already
includes dispersion physics -- v1 had no functional advisor to read at all,
so this check did not exist. Nothing in `functionals.py`'s recognized label
table is currently a vdW-inclusive functional (only LDA/PBE/PBEsol), so this
mostly guards a future functional this epic does not otherwise build.

"""composition: which elements are present, and which periodic-table
families they belong to.

Ported as content from v1's ``legacy_analysis.py:104-123`` (v2 epic 4, #1) --
the element/transition-metal/lanthanide/actinide classification itself is
correct, reusable domain knowledge; only the failure handling of the rest of
v1's ``analyze_structure`` was wrong (see ``symmetry.py``/``geometry.py``).

No ``heavy_elements`` field here, unlike v1: "heavy" means different things
to different consumers -- ``needs_soc.py`` needs atomic-number-and-block
awareness specifically for spin-orbit relevance, not a generic label every
caller would reuse the same way. One ambiguous shared definition was the
actual bug; giving each consumer its own is the fix, not renaming the same
mistake.

No ``human``/``llm`` override here, unlike ``is_metal.py``/``is_magnetic.py``/
``needs_soc.py``: which elements a structure contains is directly observable
from the structure, not a judgement call anything would plausibly want to
override.

"""namelists: the one place QE namelist syntax gets generated.

New in v2 (v2 epic 7, #7). This is the design doc's own "insertion
point" for ASE (goldilocks-core-design.md:3872: "settings -> QE
keywords, the sole translation layer, the ASE insertion point"; :4220).
No underscore in the filename -- the design doc explicitly renames v1's
``_namelists.py`` sketch because a file this frequently edited should
not look like a private implementation detail (goldilocks-core-design.md
S4.4: "the same problem: the underscore in `_namelists.py` is also
hiding something", translated).

**Which part of ASE, and why not the rest.** ``ase.io.espresso`` has two
very different tools bundled under one name:

- ``write_espresso_in`` / the ``Espresso`` calculator: atoms-driven.
  Whenever ``nspin == 2`` (or ``noncolin``) it *unconditionally*
  recomputes every ``starting_magnetization(i)`` from
  ``atoms.get_initial_magnetic_moments()`` and overwrites whatever was
  already in ``input_data`` -- verified empirically against installed
  ase 3.28 (2026-09-14): passing
  ``{"nspin": 2, "starting_magnetization(1)": 0.55}`` through
  ``write_espresso_in`` with an ``Atoms`` carrying no magnetic moments
  silently rewrites it to ``starting_magnetization(1) = 0.0`` --
  reproducing v1's exact A2 bug (nspin=2 with implicitly-zero
  magnetization) even though ``advisors/magnetic_config.py`` already
  computed the real value. This is true *regardless* of whether
  ``atoms.set_initial_magnetic_moments`` was ever called -- the branch
  only checks the resolved ``nspin``, not how it got that way. So this
  half of ASE is not used here at all: this codebase's own
  ``magnetic_config.py`` is the only place magnetism is decided, never
  ASE's moment-guessing.
- ``ase.io.espresso_namelist.namelist.Namelist``: a plain
  ``UserDict`` subclass with zero knowledge of ``Atoms``, magnetic
  moments, or pseudopotentials. ``to_nested(binary)`` sorts a flat
  ``{keyword: value}`` dict into the right namelist section by name
  (looked up in ``ase.io.espresso_namelist.keys.ALL_KEYS``, matching a
  bracketed key like ``starting_magnetization(1)`` against its base
  keyword); ``to_string()`` formats values (``True``/``False`` ->
  ``.true.``/``.false.``, everything else via ``repr``) and preserves
  indexed keys verbatim. This is the only ASE entry point used here --
  pure formatting, no derivation, so ``advisors/magnetic_config.py``'s
  resolved ``starting_magnetization``/``angle1``/``angle2`` (already
  keyed by QE species index, see ``scf.py``) pass through unchanged.

**Empty sections are dropped.** ``to_nested`` always populates every
section ``ALL_KEYS['pw']`` knows about (``&IONS``/``&CELL``/``&FCP``/
``&RISM``), even when nothing was supplied for them -- confirmed
harmless to QE but pure noise for an ``scf`` calculation, which uses
none of those. ``render_namelist`` renders only the sections that
actually received a keyword.

**Unrecognized keywords are a ``GenerationError``, not a silent drop.**
``Namelist.to_nested(..., warn=True)`` only ever raises a ``UserWarning``
for a keyword matching no known ``pw.x`` section (default: silently
dropped) -- replaces v1's bare-``KeyError``-on-typo failure mode
(``generation/qe/scf.py:167,186-188,194-195,217-219``) with a named,
boundary-validated error either way, per this epic's own invariant that
generation validates at the boundary and never surfaces a raw
``KeyError``/``UserWarning`` to a caller.

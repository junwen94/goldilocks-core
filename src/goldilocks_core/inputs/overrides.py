"""The two override bags a caller can populate for one step.

Moved here from the top-level ``inputs.py`` module (v2 epic 2, #3) once epic 3
(#4) needed ``inputs/`` to be a package: the design doc's target tree
(goldilocks-core-design.md S8) puts structure/task/code/hpc normalization
under ``inputs/`` too, and a directory and a module can't share one name.
``HumanInput``/``LlmInput`` still don't belong to any one ``analysis/``/
``advisors/`` module -- every advisor receives one, matching
``resolution.py``'s primitives -- so they land in this package rather than
in any one of its sibling files.

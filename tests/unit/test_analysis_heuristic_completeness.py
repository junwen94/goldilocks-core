"""Closes the analysis/-scoped rows of stfc/goldilocks-core#175 (v2 epic 4,
#1): every analysis/ fact's heuristic tier must be attemptable with zero
external dependency -- no installed model, no network call, no agent. This
is a claim about *availability*, not about always resolving: is_metal,
symmetry, geometry, and is_magnetic all have real cases where the honest
answer is Unavailable (see their own test files) -- that is still "the
heuristic tier ran to completion," the thing #175 asks to guarantee.
Verified here as "calling every heuristic tier on a handful of structures,
including a deliberately awkward disordered one, never raises."
